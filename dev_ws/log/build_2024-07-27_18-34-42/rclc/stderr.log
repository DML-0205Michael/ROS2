CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:129 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findosrf_testing_tools_cpp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "osrf_testing_tools_cpp", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "osrf_testing_tools_cpp" with any of the following names:

    osrf_testing_tools_cppConfig.cmake
    osrf_testing_tools_cpp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "osrf_testing_tools_cpp" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "osrf_testing_tools_cpp_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "osrf_testing_tools_cpp" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
